        <p> Hi! I'm Priyanka, a UX/UI Designer based in Quincy, Massachusetts. In the past, I've done graphic design work for Boston Partners, CBRE and Symmons Industries. While working as a graphic designer I developed an interest in UX Design so I started learning about it in my free time. I took a great course in UX/UI Design through CareerFoundry.com and I'm pursuing a course in HTML/CSS/Javascript. Currently, I work at Fidelity Investments as a UX Designer. Some of my freelance clients in UX/UI and graphic design include PlantPure Communities, Bandspage, Two95 International, Oomf, Rocklands Coffee Company etc.</p>
